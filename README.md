## Description

This project is focused on full-stack web development using MERN stack tools, languages, and npm libraries, with emphasis on GraphQL, a query language for APIs and runtime for completing queries, and the Apollo client and npm packages which will integrate GraphQL into the Express.js server.

* QueryQL application brief intro 
    * The social media discussion app contains two models under server/models/* - one model for Thought, the other to track a User. Reactions are nested inside the Thought model.
    * The development server will use Mongoose for all its MongoDB data handling, which run through the server/config/connection.js, and is exported through mongoose.connection.
    * The connection is imported by the server/server.js.    
    * Seeder dummy data can be generated via the server/seeders/seeds.js file by the Faker.js library.
    * To access the GraphQL API, schemas were created. Located under server/schemas, this location contains the type definitions (queries) and resolvers (response) which the QueryQl API accesses to perform the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
    * The Apollo server is connected to the Express.js server, as defined in the server/server.js.
    * QueryQL queries can be run in the QueryQL Playground. See the `Usage` section below for more info on starting the nodemon server, quering the db, and viewing the results in the localhost.

## Installations for this MERN application

- Prereq: install VSCode, Node.js, and MongoDB

- After cloning the GitHub repo to your local drive, run the following in the VSCode command-line terminal
- Install all components listed within the package.json file for npm
    - $ `npm i`

- Otherwise, for custom individual component installations, start by initializing npm and creating a new package.json
    - $ `npm init --y` or $ `npm install`
    - Create a .gitignore file in the root and add `node_modules` to this file
    - If you need to re-add any of the dependencies, run $ `npm install`

- Npm packages installed under the /server folder:

- Apollo Server library
    - $ `npm i apollo-server-express`
- For user authentication, to be able to encode a JSON object into a tokenized string, install JSON Web Token (JWT) package
    - $ `npm install jsonwebtoken`

- mongoose
- graphql-tag 

- Apollo-Client 
- apollo-server-express 
- apollo-boost 
- React Router 
- react-router-dom 
- apollo/react-hooks 
- if-env 
- concurrently 
- jsonwebtoken 
- jwt-decode 
- faker 
- nodemon
- brcrypt
- moment


## Usage

### Website
- The website for this website has been deployed to GitHub.
	![insert](./insert.jpg "insert")

### Local install and usage
- To view the site locally, first install the npm packages
- $ `npm i`
- Then seed the data
- $ `npm run seed`
- Start the MongoDB
- $ `mongod`
- To test the Apollo server connecting to the Express.js, (to test the schemas and server.js), run the following 
- $ `cd server`
- $ `npm run watch`
- This allows for file changes without having to restart the server. The config is setup in the package.json to run nsodeman, "watch": "nodemon".
- Use GraphQL Playground locally at `http://localhost:3001/graphql`
- Sample queries can be copied from the GraphqlPlayground-queries.md. 

- To start the application on localhost port 3001, run in the bash terminal
- $ `npm start`

## React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
